# MODSKIN-LOLPRO-updater
# The mod is fkn 10y old and has'nt a self-updater.

<br/><h3>Usage:<h3> Just run the exec from the newest release and have fun 

<br/>Actually it's just run the file and it will automatically download the current version of the mod on the website http://leagueskin.net/p/download-mod-skin-2020-chn then will run it, and delete the dowloaded zip file.

<br/>The only issue in the code, is not actually inside it. If the file on the website of the mod is not yet updated (which is common on the first days of patch), the updater will download and install an old version of the mod.

<br/>Note: Windows OS may mark this program as malware because it is made of python, and for WinDefender if it's python, there is malware. If you're afraid about it, github has a seal of approval
